                Rigging sound systems can be complex, and safety is paramount. Here's a guide to get you started:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                <li className="mb-6">
                    <strong>Select the Right Rigging Equipment:</strong>
                    <br />
                    <ul style={{ marginLeft: "2rem", listStyleType: "disc" }} className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-2 mb-4">
                        <li className="mb-2">
                            Choose rigging hardware such as shackles, slings, and hoists that are rated for the weight of the speakers you are hanging.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use appropriate connectors to avoid putting stress on the equipment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mb-6">
                    <strong>Prepare the Location:</strong>
                    <br />
                    <ul style={{ marginLeft: "2rem", listStyleType: "disc" }} className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-2 mb-4">
                        <li className="mb-2">
                            Ensure the rigging point is solid and can support the weight of the speakers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you're rigging from a ceiling, use certified beams or trusses designed for load-bearing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <strong>Common Rigging Tools and Their Proper Usage:</strong>
                <br />
                There are various rigging tools you'll need to safely hang your speakers:
            </p>
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: "2rem", listStyleType: "disc" }} className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                <li className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Shackles:</strong>
                    <br />
                    Used for connecting rigging points to the suspension system. Always use the correct size and ensure they are tightened properly.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Slings:</strong>
                    <br />
                    These are used for suspending the load. Ensure that the slings are rated for the weight you intend to carry.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Hoists &amp; Winches:</strong>
                    <br />
                    These tools are used to raise or lower heavy equipment. They should be checked regularly for wear and tear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Safety Cables:</strong>
                    <br />
                    Always use safety cables as a backup to prevent falls or equipment failures.
